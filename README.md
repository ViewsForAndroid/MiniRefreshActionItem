MiniRefreshActionItem
=====================

NOTE: This is a work in progress is not finished yet!

Just another action bar item that implements this common pattern (in a mini way!).

This library just only includes two use cases (and nothing more):

- A refresh icon that when the user clicks the component, it shows an indeterminate ProgressBar.
- A refresh icon that when the user clicks the component, it starts to rotate itself.

Sample image:

If you want, you can see it live in the sample application (Not yet uploaded!):

</a>

Why did you bother to create another library when we have RefreshActionItem made by Manuel Peinado?
===================================================================================================

The main reason on why I did it is because I just wanted to learn how to release a library to Maven Central with Gradle.
Nothing more.

If you don't need any of the features that RefreshActionItem provides, like Pie or Badge indicator types, then go ahead and
use mine, the API is almost the same and the only differences are in how the source code is structured inside.

Including it in your project
----------------------------

```gradle
dependencies {
  compile 'com.aldoborrero:minirefreshactionitem:1.0.+'
}
```

* Big thanks to Manuel Peinado for creating [RefreshActionItem][1] in which this simple library has ripped some parts of
its source code.
